==Inventory Management System==

This application is geared towards a inventory system 
which is ran by barcodes, searchable, and able to be put in a cart and invoiced.
This would be locked away from general use and put to use on networked computer
at my friends shop.

First off, it does none of this right now.
I am just learning Ruby on Rails, have done a couple tutorials but still at a loss
for some ideas. I've messed with programming before and understand the direction
I am looking to go, its just learning the tools I have to work with and what would
best to do so.

Thanks
